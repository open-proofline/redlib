# Redlib

> A privacy-focused front-end to Reddit, with its origins in [Libreddit](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit).

This repository is `open-proofline/redlib`, a Proofline-operated fork of
[upstream Redlib](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib) for a best-effort public
community service. Upstream Redlib remains the source of truth for core Redlib
behavior. Proofline-specific changes in this fork should stay small,
transparent, and separate from changes that could be contributed upstream.

This fork is separate from Proofline safety, evidence, account, mobile, and
protocol systems. It does not provide emergency reliability, account-portal
features, recording or capture workflows, trusted-contact decryption, key escrow,
notifications, billing, or Proofline protocol behavior. Privacy language in this
README describes proxying and application behavior; it is not an anonymity claim.

**10-second pitch:** Redlib is a privacy-focused front-end like [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) but for Reddit. Browse the coldest takes of [r/unpopularopinion](https://farside.link/redlib/r/unpopularopinion) with less direct browser exposure to Reddit.

- 🚀 Fast: written in Rust for blazing-fast speeds and memory safety
- ☁️ Light: no ads, no behavioral tracking, and no third-party or tracking JavaScript
- 🕵 Proxying: Reddit API and media requests are handled through the Redlib server where supported
- 🔒 Browser controls: a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) restricts browser-initiated network access

# Fork Scope

This fork follows upstream Redlib for browsing behavior, templates, route
semantics, and Reddit-facing behavior unless a local fork delta is called out
explicitly. The fork-specific surface is limited to repository governance,
Proofline community-service wording, CI and image publishing policy, and
packaging examples for `ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib`.

Use upstream Redlib resources for generic Redlib issues, feature behavior, and
source history. Use this fork's repository and GHCR package when you specifically
need the Proofline-operated fork source or container image.

Fork image tags use `upstream-<version>` to identify the Redlib package version
from `Cargo.toml`. That tag is not a separate Proofline product release.

# About

> [!NOTE]
> Upstream Redlib resources: 💬 [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#redlib:matrix.org), :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib), and 🦊 [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/redlib/redlib). Proofline fork resources: :octocat: [GitHub](https://github.com/open-proofline/redlib) and 🐋 [GHCR](https://github.com/open-proofline/redlib/pkgs/container/redlib).

Redlib hopes to provide an easier way to browse Reddit, without the ads, trackers, and bloat. Redlib was inspired by other alternative front-ends to popular services such as [Invidious](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious) for YouTube, [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) for Twitter, and [Bibliogram](https://sr.ht/~cadence/bibliogram/) for Instagram.

Redlib currently implements most of Reddit's (signed-out) functionalities but still lacks [a few features](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/issues).

## Built with

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - Programming language
- [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) - HTTP server and client
- [Askama](https://github.com/askama-rs/askama) - Templating engine
- [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq) - HTTP client with BoringSSL support

## How is it different from other Reddit front ends?

### Teddit

Teddit is another awesome open source project designed to provide an alternative frontend to Reddit. There is no connection between the two, and you're welcome to use whichever one you favor. Competition fosters innovation and Teddit's release has motivated me to build Redlib into an even more polished product.

If you are looking to compare, the biggest differences I have noticed are:

- Redlib is themed around Reddit's redesign whereas Teddit appears to stick much closer to Reddit's old design. This may suit some users better as design is always subjective.
- Redlib is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) for speed and memory safety. It uses [Hyper](https://hyper.rs), a speedy and lightweight HTTP server/client implementation.

### Libreddit

While originating as a fork of Libreddit, the name "Redlib" was adopted to avoid legal issues, as Reddit only allows the use of their name if structured as "XYZ For Reddit".

Several technical improvements have also been made, including:

- **OAuth token spoofing**: To circumvent rate limits imposed by Reddit, OAuth token spoofing is used to mimic the most common iOS and Android clients. While spoofing both iOS and Android clients was explored, only the Android client was chosen due to content restrictions when using an unauthenticated iOS client.
- **Token refreshing**: The authentication token is refreshed every 24 hours, emulating the behavior of the official Android app.
- **HTTP header mimicking**: Efforts are made to send along as many of the official app's headers as possible to reduce the likelihood of Reddit's crackdown on Redlib's requests.

# Comparison

This section outlines how Redlib compares to Reddit in terms of speed and privacy.

## Speed

Last tested on January 12, 2024.

Results from Google PageSpeed Insights ([Redlib Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fredlib.matthew.science%2F), [Reddit Report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https://www.reddit.com)).

| Performance metric  | Redlib   | Reddit    |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| Speed Index         | 0.6s     | 1.9s      |
| Performance Score   | 100%     | 64%       |
| Time to Interactive | **2.8s** | **12.4s** |

## Privacy

### Reddit

**Logging:** According to Reddit's [privacy policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy), they "may [automatically] log information" including:

- IP address
- User-agent string
- Browser type
- Operating system
- Referral URLs
- Device information (e.g., device IDs)
- Device settings
- Pages visited
- Links clicked
- The requested URL
- Search terms

**Location:** The same privacy policy goes on to describe that location data may be collected through the use of:

- GPS (consensual)
- Bluetooth (consensual)
- Content associated with a location (consensual)
- Your IP Address

**Cookies:** Reddit's [cookie notice](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/cookies) documents the array of cookies used by Reddit including/regarding:

- Authentication
- Functionality
- Analytics and Performance
- Advertising
- Third-Party Cookies
- Third-Party Site

### Redlib

For transparency, this section describes how Redlib handles browser requests,
upstream requests, caching, logging, and cookies. It does not mean Redlib makes
users anonymous.

#### Server

- **Request forwarding:** Redlib fetches Reddit API responses and proxied media
  server-side. For proxied content, Reddit and related media hosts receive
  requests from the Redlib instance rather than a direct browser request. The
  instance operator, network provider, reverse proxy, DNS provider, and upstream
  services may still see traffic metadata or request details depending on the
  deployment.

- **Caching:** Redlib uses in-memory caches for some upstream responses and sends
  cache headers for static assets. Caching improves performance, but it is not a
  privacy boundary.

- **Logging:** Redlib does not add HTTP access logging by default. It does
  initialize runtime logging and may emit startup, rate-limit, upstream request,
  upstream error, and server error messages depending on build and runtime
  logging configuration. Reverse proxies, container runtimes, hosting platforms,
  or network providers may keep their own logs. Operators should treat raw logs
  as sensitive and avoid publishing them.

- **Cookies:** Redlib uses optional first-party cookies to store settings,
  subscriptions, filters, and related preferences configured through the
  settings UI. These are not cross-site cookies.

# Deployment

This section covers common ways to run Redlib. The maintained container image
for this fork is `ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib`, built from the root
`Dockerfile`. Other runtime examples are convenience notes and should be reviewed
against upstream Redlib and your own deployment requirements before use.

For configuration options, see the [Configuration section](#configuration).

## Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) lets you run containerized applications. Containers are loosely isolated environments that are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so there's no need to rely on what's installed on the host.

Container images for this Proofline-operated fork are published at `ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib` from `main` and maintainer-triggered manual publishes. This is a best-effort public community-service fork and is separate from Proofline safety, evidence, account, and protocol infrastructure.

Available fork image tags include:

- `latest` and `main` from the current `main` branch image.
- `sha-<commit>` for a specific fork commit.
- `upstream-<version>`, where `<version>` is the Redlib package version from `Cargo.toml`.

The `upstream-<version>` tag identifies the upstream Redlib base version and is updated as this fork imports newer upstream Redlib releases. It is not a Proofline Redlib release tag.

### Docker CLI

Deploy Redlib:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib:latest
docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib:latest
```

Deploy using a different port on the host (in this case, port 80):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib:main
docker run -d --name redlib -p 80:8080 ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib:main
```

If you're using a reverse proxy in front of Redlib, prefix the port numbers with `127.0.0.1` so that Redlib only listens on the host port **locally**. For example, if the host port for Redlib is `8080`, specify `127.0.0.1:8080:8080`.

Stream logs from the Redlib container:

```bash
docker logs -f redlib
```
## Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) lets you run containerized applications in a rootless fashion. Containers are loosely isolated environments that are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so there's no need to rely on what's installed on the host.

Container images for this Proofline-operated fork are published at `ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib` from `main` and maintainer-triggered manual publishes.

### Quadlets

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions assume that you are on a systemd based distro with [podman](https://podman.io/). If not, follow these [instructions on podman's website](https://podman.io/docs/installation) for how to do so. 
> It also assumes you have used `loginctl enable-linger <username>` to enable the service to start for your user without logging in.

Copy the `redlib.container` and `.env.example` files to `.config/containers/systemd/` and modify any relevant values (for example, the ports Redlib should listen on, renaming the .env file and editing its values, etc.).

To start Redlib either reboot or follow the instructions below:

Notify systemd of the new files
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Start the newly generated service file

```bash
systemctl --user start redlib.service
```

You can check the status of your container by using the following command:
```bash 
systemctl --user status redlib.service
```

## Binary

This fork does not publish separate binary releases. If you want an upstream
Redlib binary, use [upstream Redlib releases](https://github.com/redlib-org/redlib/releases/latest)
and verify the current version, asset name, and checksum there.

After downloading an upstream binary, make it executable and change its ownership
to `root` if you plan to install it system-wide:

```bash
sudo chmod +x redlib && sudo chown root:root redlib
```

Copy the binary to `/usr/bin`:

```bash
sudo cp ./redlib /usr/bin/redlib
```

Start Redlib on the default listener (`[::]:8080` unless configured):

```bash
redlib
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're proxying Redlib through NGINX (see [issue #122](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit/issues/122#issuecomment-782226853)), add
>
> ```nginx
> proxy_http_version 1.1;
> ```
>
> to your NGINX configuration file above your `proxy_pass` line.

### Running as a systemd service

You can use the systemd service available in `contrib/redlib.service`
(install it on `/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service`).

That service can be optionally configured in terms of environment variables by
creating a file in `/etc/redlib.conf`. Use the `contrib/redlib.conf` as a
template. You can also add the `REDLIB_DEFAULT__{X}` settings explained
above.

When "Proxying using NGINX" where the proxy is on the same machine, you should
guarantee nginx waits for this service to start. Edit
`/etc/systemd/system/redlib.service.d/reverse-proxy.conf`:

```conf
[Unit]
Before=nginx.service
```

## Building from source

To run this fork from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-proofline/redlib && cd redlib
cargo run
```

## launchd (macOS)

If you are on macOS, you can use the [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd) service available in `contrib/redlib.plist`.

Install it with `cp contrib/redlib.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/`.

Load and start it with `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/redlib.plist`.

<!-- ## Cargo

Make sure Rust stable is installed along with `cargo`, Rust's package manager.

```bash
cargo install libreddit
``` -->

<!-- ## AUR

For ArchLinux users, Redlib is available from the AUR as [`libreddit-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libreddit-git).

```bash
yay -S libreddit-git
```
## NetBSD/pkgsrc

For NetBSD users, Redlib is available from the official repositories.

```bash
pkgin install libreddit
```

Or, if you prefer to build from source

```bash
cd /usr/pkgsrc/libreddit
make install
``` -->

---

# Configuration

You can configure Redlib further using environment variables. For example:

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_SHOW_NSFW=on redlib
```

```bash
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE=on REDLIB_DEFAULT_THEME=dark redlib -r
```

You can also configure Redlib with a configuration file named `redlib.toml`. For example:

```toml
REDLIB_DEFAULT_WIDE = "on"
REDLIB_DEFAULT_USE_HLS = "on"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're deploying Redlib using the **Docker CLI**, environment variables can be defined in a [`.env` file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/set-environment-variables/), allowing you to centralize and manage configuration in one place.
>
> To configure Redlib using a `.env` file, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it accordingly.
>
> If using the Docker CLI, add ` --env-file .env` to the command that runs Redlib. For example:
>
> ```bash
> docker run -d --name redlib -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env ghcr.io/open-proofline/redlib:main
> ```

## Command Line Flags

Redlib supports the following command line flags:

- `-4`, `--ipv4-only`: Listen on IPv4 only.
- `-6`, `--ipv6-only`: Listen on IPv6 only.
- `-r`, `--redirect-https`: Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS (no longer functional).
- `-a`, `--address <ADDRESS>`: Sets address to listen on. Default is `[::]`.
- `-p`, `--port <PORT>`: Port to listen on. Default is `8080`.
- `-H`, `--hsts <EXPIRE_TIME>`: HSTS header to tell browsers that this site should only be accessed over HTTPS. Default is `604800`.

## Instance settings

Assign a default value for each instance-specific setting by passing environment variables to Redlib in the format `REDLIB_{X}`. Replace `{X}` with the setting name (see list below) in capital letters.

## Forward Proxies

Redlib [supports](https://docs.rs/wreq/latest/wreq/#proxies) proxy usage using the standard `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables. Use `ALL_PROXY` to set both at the same time (which you want to do).

- `http://` is the scheme for http proxy
- `https://` is the scheme for https proxy
- `socks4://` is the scheme for socks4 proxy
- `socks4a://` is the scheme for socks4a proxy
- `socks5://` is the scheme for socks5 proxy
- `socks5h://` is the scheme for socks5h proxy

## Security

This project uses [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/), built from source with patches from
the [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq) project. Certificates are validated against the embedded trust store from Mozilla.

## Building

Since Redlib uses [`boring-sys2`](https://crates.io/crates/boring-sys2), to build Redlib you will need to build
BoringSSL from source.

### Linux/MacOS

Refer to the [boringssl](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/main/BUILDING.md) documentation for dependencies.

### Windows

Install MSVC, which you likely already have for Rust.

```pwsh
# Make sure to update your PATH, some of the installers don't do that by default (hense -i, interactive mode).
winget install -i Kitware.CMake
winget install -i NASM.NASM
winget install -i LLVM.LLVM

# For tests.
winget install GoLang.Go
```
